# Django_boards

## Introduction
Django Boards is a basic django project that is used to create boards, topics and posts
Only the admins are able to create the boards and the topics and posts can be created by
both the admins and the users
The project is part of my Djnago learning series which helped me understand Django from the basic concepts such as setting up django application, create the django application, working with views and models, unittesting in django, templates and static files, django forms and authentication.

## Project structure
The project has two applications started which are the
* The boards applications
  * This application handles the creation of the boards, topics and posts
* The accounts application
  * This application handles the authentication of the users
### The rest is pure django setup folder structure 

## Current Status
The project is still under development with issues on the user authentication section which is being worked on at the moment

## Usuage
The project would help groups of people that work in teams where the team leader can generate a boad and the team members can contribute to the board as they share discussions

## Tech Stack
currently the project is completely sa django mvc project running on the django ORM, Django template language and the Django form authentication
