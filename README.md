# Django_boards

## Introduction
Django Boards is a basic django project that is used to create boards, topics and posts
Only the admins are able to create the boards and the topics and posts can be created by
both the admins and the users
The project is part of my Djnago learning series which helped me understand Django from the basic concepts such as setting up django application, create the django application, working with views and models, unittesting in django, templates and static files, django forms and authentication.
